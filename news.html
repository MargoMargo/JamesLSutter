		<div class="blogContent"><p><img src="/images/Pathfinder_Goblins_2.jpg" align="right" width="300">It's been a few months since the last update, and now you can see why! My exceptionally talented wife, Margo Arnold, has helped me completely overhaul this site, and I couldn't be happier with the result. (If you see anything broken or displaying improperly, however, please drop me a line.)
		</p>
		<p>So what else has been going on this summer?</p>
		<ul>
		<li>My next novel has been announced! <i>The Redemption Engine</i>, the sequel to <i>Death's Heretic</i>, will hit the streets in April 2014. Someone is stealing souls from Hell, and the word on the street is that they're giving the villains free passes into Heaven--whether they want them or not. Now Salim Ghadafar, an atheist investigator forced against his will to solve problems for the goddess of death, must descend into the outlaw city of Kaer Maga, following a trail that leads from the very gates of Heaven to the iron fortresses of Hell. Along the way, he’ll be aided by a host of otherworldly creatures, a streetwise teenager, and two warriors of the mysterious Iridian Fold. But when the missing souls are the scum of the earth, and the victims devils themselves, can anyone really be trusted? Stay tuned for more information as the release date approaches!</li>
		<li>A few weeks ago I was invited to speak about games and tie-in writing at Clarion West, perhaps the most prestigious science fiction and fantasy writing workshop around. Needless to say, speaking at the same workshop as authors like Neil Gaiman and Joe Hill was a thrill and an honor, and I had a great time hanging out with the Clarion class!</li>
		<li>I had the chance to write part of a comic book! <i>Pathfinder Goblins! #2</i> features my story "Magic Pig," paired with the story "The Glorious Demise of Gurgle and Deep" by acclaimed comics writer Charles Soule of <i>Swamp Thing</i>, <i>27</i>, <i>Wonder Woman</i>, and more.</li>
		<li>I've sold two new stories, "New Growth" and "Suits," to the anthologies <i>By Faerie Light</i> and <i>War Stories</i>.</li>
		<li>Gen Con was, as usual, both a ton of fun and completely exhausting! Many thanks to Marc Tassin and the Writer's Symposium, as well as to all the awesome writers and fans who stopped by to chat or get books signed.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In short: the world is an awesome place, and I'm excited about everything!</p>

		<p>In other news, just before I left, I was also fortunate enough to be able to

		<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.patrickrothfuss.com/2013/01/geekery-for-gamers/">

		</p>
		<p>

		<blockquote>&quot;I’ve only recently started to dabble with Pathfinder, but I have to say that what I’ve seen has impressed me. A lot. Some of the advice in their books has changed the way I’ve thought about running a game, and even influenced my storytelling somewhat.&quot;</p>
			</blockquote>
		<p>Given what a huge fan I am of <i>The Name of the Wind
			</i>and <i>The Wise Man's Fear</i>, that's high praise indeed. Thank,

		supercarrier, and one of the largest warships ever constructed by
		humanity--invited Paizo staff aboard for a thorough tour of the closest thing
		the real world has to a star destroyer. (That picture is me sitting in the boss

Sword &amp; Laser</a>, in which we talked about things
like writing in shared worlds, the origins of Pathfinder, Machine of Death, the
books that inspire us, tips for folks taking a shot at NaNoWriMo (hint: just
keep writing), and even the Secret Paizo Motto. Thanks to some sort of computer

I'm back from the odyssey that was this year's World
Fantasy Convention, and as always, I can't thank enough the various friends, old
and new, who made it such a blast. Yet while I'm concentrating on lying very
still and trying not to expire from sheer exhaustion, there are two new
interviews to check out!</p>
<p>

First up, the Slice of SciFi radio show did an
interview with me and Paizo Editor-in-Chief Wes Schneider, which in addition to
showing up on satellite radio can also be watched as a webcast TV show. We
talked about Pathfinder's origins, Pathfinder Tales, and the secret agenda
behind writing <i>Death's Heretic</i>, which they were kind enough to
call &quot;a fantastic book.&quot; You can
<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sliceofscifi.com/2012/10/31/slice-of-scifi-509/">
listen to or watch the interview here</a> (starting
around nine minutes in).
	</p>
<p>

Second, the Know Direction podcast did an interview
with me and Pathfinder Tales author Dave Gross about about his new book <i>
Queen of Thorns</i> and my work designing Pathfinder's solar system,
<a target="_blank" href="http://35privatesanctuary.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=474:know-direction-49-distant-tales&catid=35:the-tome-know-direction&Itemid=34">

This past Gen Con, I was fortunate enough to be
invited onto Writing Excuses, the amazing podcast for writers run by Brandon
Sanderson, Mary Robinette Kowal, and Howard Taylor, as they recorded some
episodes in front of a live audience. It was an absolute blast, and

In other new, my latest Pathfinder adventure, <i>
The Asylum Stone</i>, is set to hit stores on the 31st, so it seems like a
great opportunity to show off the cover (courtesy of my friend Wayne Reynolds,
one of the best fantasy illustrators in the business). Believe it or not, it
didn't occur to me until right now that we're releasing a headless horseman
cover on Halloween...<p align="center">

The Geek Love Kickstarter has finished, and at almost $33,000 dollars has
succeeded far beyond anyone's wildest dreams, making it one of the best-funded
publishing projects around! Thanks to everyone who supported it, and I hope that
the huge amount of sexy nerdity the book (and audiobook!) contains will float
your boat!</p>
<p>

Seattleites--this Saturday I'll be playing at a benefit show for the Bike Shack,
an awesome nonprofit that helps fix or build bikes for people for free, and
which recently had all their tools stolen. I'll be playing a short &quot;Greatest
Hits&quot; set with several special guests, and there are a ton of other bands
involved, from eccentric back-porch stomp-along folk music to the danciest of
techno. (It should be noted that I had no idea the organizers were putting my
picture on the poster until they sent it to me--in my opinion, The Mongrel Jews
and Foreign Friends are likely to steal the show!)



	</p>
<p>

Details: 8017 1st Ave NE Seattle--the suggested donation is $5, sliding-scale
bike tune-ups starts at 5:00, and music starts at 7:00. Expect much hilarity,
raffles, a strip show or two, and general good times!<br>

	Geek Love: An Anthology of Full-Frontal Nerdity</a></i>.
	My story is called &quot;Raid Night,&quot;<i> </i>and is about a couple
	struggling with MMO addiction.


	</p>
<p>

	Wait, did I say MMO addiction? I meant <i>sexy</i> MMO addiction!
	Because everyone knows that there's nothing hotter than frustrated
	relationships!</p>
<p>

	Seriously, though--I'm honored to be included in the anthology alongside
	some really kick-ass authors and artists, and I hope you'll check it out.
	The ebook will be for sale in perpetuity once the book's released, but if
	you want one of the gorgeous hardback paper copies, you'll want to

	&quot;The Gray Zone: Moral Ambiguity in Fantasy.&quot;</a>

	Hey everyone! I just published a new guest essay over at Inkpunks called
	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.inkpunks.com/2012/07/02/masters-of-the-controverse-why-authors-should-speak-their-minds/">
	&quot;Masters of the Controverse: Why Authors Should Speak
	Their Minds.&quot;</a> Too often in this business, authors (and
	politicians, and other public figures) are told that they should sanitize
	their images and never speak about controversial topics. Yet I believe that
	not only is it important for everyone to be able to address the issues that
	matter to them, but that, contrary to popular wisdom, doing so can actually
	lead to a stronger fan base. <br>

In somewhat less related news, yesterday was a snow day, which everyone in
Seattle knows is a spontaneous holiday. I rode a sled through a stranger's hedge
at 30 miles per hour while blowing a plastic trumpet. As far as I'm concerned,
if your snow day doesn't end with shouts of &quot;I'm in a tree! I'M IN A TREE!&quot; you
may need to reconsider your lifestyle.</p>

</a>Another podcast story? It's true! The illustrious PodCastle has just
released &quot;Ties of Silver,&quot; which I originally published in <i>Beast Within 2:
Predator &amp; Prey</i>, as a free podcast that
<a target="_blank" href="http://podcastle.org/2011/12/13/podcastle-187-ties-of-silver/">
you can listen to here.</a> The story is a noir
piece about a city where all werewolves and other lycanthropes are kept in a
WW2-style ghetto and forced to take tinctures of silver to control their
changing if they want to leave the reservation (a &quot;solution&quot; that also marks
them by turning their skin blue).

it's absolutely surreal. Thank you, everyone!</p>

</a>Josh Vogt gave <i>Death's Heretic</i> a glowing review over at Examiner--extra
heartening because he apparently didn't realize it was tie-in fiction when he
first picked it up! Here's an excerpt:</p>
<p>

<i>"Excellent writing, a fascinating character, and a solid fantasy-mystery plot... Salim is a marvelous character to be introduced to this universe through. Neila is a great counterpoint... she avoids falling into the trap of being nothing more than a pretty face for Salim to rescue every other chapter. Refreshing, that. With its intriguing protagonist, twisted magics, and unique environments, it's well worth discovering..."

	In totally non-literary news, the musical I co-wrote and acted in last year
	is finally on the web! As a present for a friend, a cast and crew of about
	20 folks got together and wrote &quot;The Science of Science,&quot; a morality play
	starring said friend as a scientist struggling against a society that can't
	be bothered with facts. In addition to writing about half the music (the
	other half being provided by my good friend Andy Greenlee, in accordance
	with a script by Michelle Burce), I got to shave off my beard and play the
	lead, while another friend did a terrifyingly good job of playing the
	character of me (talk about surreal!). Most of the folks involved were
	taking the stage for the first time, and the result is astonishing.
