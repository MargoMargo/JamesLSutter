	<p>	Nobody cheats death! A warrior haunted by his past, Salim Ghadafar serves
	as a problem-solver for a church he hates, bound by the goddess of
	death to hunt down those who would rob her of her due. Such is the
	case in the desert nation of Thuvia, where a powerful merchant on
	the verge of achieving eternal youth via a magical elixir is
	mysteriously murdered, his soul kidnapped somewhere along its path
	to the afterlife. The only clue is a magical ransom note, offering
	to trade the merchantâ€™s successful resurrection for his dose of the
	fabled potion. But who would have the power to steal a soul from the
	boneyard of Death herself? Enter Salim, whose keen mind and contacts
	throughout the multiverse should make solving this mystery a cinch.
	There's only one problem: The investigation is being financed by
	Neila Anvanory, the dead merchant's stubborn and aristocratic
	daughter. And she wants to go with him. </p>
	<p>Along with his uninvited passenger, Salim must unravel a web of intrigue
	that will lead them far from the blistering sands of Thuvia on a
	grand tour of the Outer Planes, where devils and angels rub
	shoulders with fey lords and mechanical men, and nothing is as it
	seems... </p>

	<p><b>What people are saying about the novel:</b></p>

	<p>&quot;A classic noir transposed to a
	fantasy setting, though not in the Jim Butcher sense... a unique, fascinating, engaging, and interesting fantasy work.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Lou Anders, Hugo Award-winning SF editor</p>

	<p>&quot;What a great yarn! It grabbed me at the outset and raced along, all of
	the characters coming alive but the action never flagging. Action, mystery,
	planar splendors and dangers, really memorable characters -- this one has it
	all.&quot; <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Ed Greenwood,  <i>New York Times</i> best-selling
	author of<i>
	Elminster Must Die</i> </p>

	<p>&quot;A stellar first novel&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Paul Goat Allen, Barnes &amp; Noble</p>
	<p>&quot;A fantastic book&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- <i>Slice of SciFi</i></p>

	<p>&quot;Strange and colorful lands, engaging characters, mystery and action --
	Sutter delivers. Watch this guy. &quot; <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Howard Andrew Jones, author of <i>The Desert of Souls</i></p>
