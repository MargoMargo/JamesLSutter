	<b>Ranked #3 on Barnes &amp; Noble's Best Fantasy Releases of 
	2011</b></a></p>
	<p><b>Finalist for the 2012 Compton Crook Award for Best 
	First Novel</b></p>
	<p><b>Nominated for a 2013 Origins Award for Best Game-Related Publication</b></p>
	
	<p>&quot;What a great yarn! It grabbed me at the outset and raced along, all of 
	the characters coming alive but the action never flagging. Action, mystery, 
	planar splendors and dangers, really memorable characters -- this one has it 
	all.&quot; <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Ed Greenwood,  <i>New York Times</i> bestselling 
	author of<i> 
	Elminster Must Die</i> </p>
	
	<p>&quot;The novel reads like (and actually is) a classic noir transposed to a 
	fantasy setting, though not in the Jim Butcher sense... a unique, fascinating, engaging, and interesting fantasy work that I have no trouble recommending highly.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Lou Anders, Hugo Award-winning SF editor</p>
	<p>&quot;A stellar first novel&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Paul Goat Allen, Barnes &amp; Noble</p>
	<p>&quot;A fantastic book&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- <i>Slice of SciFi</i></p>
	
	<p>&quot;Strange and colorful lands, engaging characters, mystery and action -- 
	Sutter delivers. Watch this guy. &quot; <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Howard Andrew Jones, author of <i>The Desert of Souls</i></p>
	<p>&quot;Death’s Heretic is most certainly a killer worth catching.&quot;<i> <br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i><i>-- </i>Ben McFarland,<i> Kobold Quarterly</i></p>
	<p>
	&quot;Well-written fantasy. Salim is a fascinating character who readers will eagerly follow... richly imagined and full of vibrant life."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Holly Scudero, <i>Tulsa Book Review</i></p>
	<p>"Excellent writing, a fascinating character, and a solid fantasy-mystery plot... Salim is a marvelous character to be introduced to this universe through. Neila is a great counterpoint... she avoids falling into the trap of being nothing more than a pretty face for Salim to rescue every other chapter. Refreshing, that. With its intriguing protagonist, twisted magics, and unique environments, it's well worth discovering..."
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Josh Vogt, <i>Examiner.com</i></p>
	<p>&quot;A nonstop romp through fabulous settings"<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Jaym Gates, <i>Functional Nerds</i></p>
	
	<p>&quot;James Sutter has a way with descriptions, which tend to be both concise 
	yet vivid. His writing flows smoothly, whether we're following his main 
	characters across the desert or across the planes of existence... <i>
	Death's Heretic</i> is more intellectual than the average RPG novel, 
	dealing with topics such as personal faith, mortality, and self 
	actualization in an honest, adult manner that you don't normally find in 
	this type of fantasy.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- <i>Quest For Fun</i></p>
	
	<p>&quot;I really enjoyed this book. The writing was strong, the story was interesting, I loved the characters, and the setting was so well wrought that I could practically feel the sand and heat of the desert on my face. I love when authors write with authority and have the skill to back it up, and James Sutter has skill in excess. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to anyone. Well done, sir. Very well done."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Justin Macumber, <i>Dead Robots' Society</i></p>
	<p>&quot;Raistlin Majere, Elminster, and Drizzt Do’Urden all come to mind as 
	iconic characters born in roleplaying tie-in novels. Into this esteemed 
	category steps Salim Ghadafar, the protagonist of James L. Sutter's <i>
	Death's Heretic....</i> Compelling and full of action... a great 
	standalone novel in its own right.&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Andrew Zimmerman Jones, <i>Black Gate</i></p>
	<p>"Death's Heretic channels the spirit of classic sword & sorcery, adapts it for a modern audience, and is sprinkled with Sutter's personal touch. It makes for fast, leisurely reading, the equivalent of a summer blockbuster movie."<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Charles A Tan, <i>Bibliophile Stalker</i></p>
	<p>
	"If you enjoy church-appointed monster assassins, check this one out."
	<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Dave Thompson, <i>PodCastle</i></p>
	<p>&quot;An awful lot of fun, and a lot of imagination-<wbr>-I really enjoyed it.<wbr> 
	I'd love to see some more stories involving Salim.<wbr>&quot;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Art Sippo, <i>Book Cave</i></p>

	<div class="reviewTitle">Miscarriage</div>
	<p>&quot;The most touching [story in <i>Machine of Death</i>] is James L. 
	Sutter’s 'Miscarriage.'&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Rod Lott, Bookgasm.com</p>
	<p><b>Chosen as the &quot;representative sample&quot; in a positive <i>Machine of 
	Death </i>review by <i>The Believer</i>.</b></p>

	<div class="reviewTitle">The Long Road To The Sea</div>
	<p>&quot;A beautifully written story about people who, after dying, regain life, 
	but not all of their humanity. A tragic tale of lost love.&quot; <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Rena Hawkins, <i>Tangent</i> </p>

<hr>
	<div class="reviewTitle">Before They Were Giants</div>
	<p>&quot;Really good reading about the start-up stages of many distinguished 
	careers.&quot; <br>
